# Usage

Here's a an example of converting meters to nautical miles.

    var iotdb = require('iotdb');
    var _ = iotdb._;
    iotdb.modules(); // this will load extensions

    var nms = _.convert.convert({
        from: 'iot-unit:length.si.meter',
        to: 'iot-unit:length.imperial.nautical-mile',
        value: 1000,
    });
    console.log(nms);

And yards to inches

    var inches = _.convert.convert({
        from: 'iot-unit:length.imperial.yard',
        to: 'iot-unit:length.imperial.inch',
        value: 1
    });
    console.log(inches);

KM to inches

    var inches = _.convert.convert({
        from: 'iot-unit:length.si.meter.3', // m * 10^3 = km
        to: 'iot-unit:length.imperial.inch',
        value: 1
    });
    console.log(inches);

just let us know (or fork and add it yourself)
